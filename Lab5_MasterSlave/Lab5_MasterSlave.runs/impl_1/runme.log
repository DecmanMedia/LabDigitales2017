WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (DPOP-1) PREG Output pipelining - DSP slavecito/ALU_DISPLAY/alucito/result_temp0 output slavecito/ALU_DISPLAY/alucito/result_temp0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (DPOP-2) MREG Output pipelining - DSP slavecito/ALU_DISPLAY/alucito/result_temp0 multiplier stage slavecito/ALU_DISPLAY/alucito/result_temp0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net slavecito/ALU_DISPLAY/result_t_reg[15]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin slavecito/ALU_DISPLAY/result_t_reg[15]_i_2/O, cell slavecito/ALU_DISPLAY/result_t_reg[15]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
